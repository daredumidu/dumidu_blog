# Minimalist GitHub Pages Blog

This repository contains a minimalist static blog that reads posts from Markdown files.

How it works:
- posts/index.json contains a list of posts (slug, title, date, excerpt, filename).
- Each post file is stored in posts/{filename}.md (plain markdown).
- index.html and script.js fetch posts/index.json, render the list, and fetch & render the markdown for a selected post (uses marked.js).

To publish on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a repository on GitHub and push these files to the main branch (or whichever branch you host from).
2. In the repository Settings â†’ Pages, select the branch (e.g., main) and folder (root).
3. Save. Your site will be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/ (or at your custom domain if configured).

To add a new post:
1. Add a new Markdown file to the posts/ folder, e.g. `my-post.md`.
2. Add a new entry to `posts/index.json` with:
   - slug: used in the URL/hash (e.g., "my-post")
   - title
   - date (ISO-ish string, e.g., "2025-10-15")
   - excerpt (short string for the list)
   - filename: the markdown filename, e.g. "my-post.md"

Limitations & notes:
- This is intentionally minimal and has no build step. The posts index must be updated manually (or by your own script).
- If you want automatic index generation, add a small script that scans posts/ and generates posts/index.json at commit time or via GitHub Actions.
- Uses marked.js from CDN; you can vendor it locally if you prefer.

Enjoy!
