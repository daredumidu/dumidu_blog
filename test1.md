# Access Control Reviews: An Auditor’s Lens

In today’s regulatory and risk-driven environment, auditors are expected not only to verify compliance but also to critically assess whether access controls are truly effective in safeguarding systems and sensitive data. One key area of focus is the **Access Control Review (ACR)** — a process that ensures only the right people have the right level of access, at the right time.

In this post, we’ll walk through how an auditor might approach access control reviews across three different environments:

- **Accounting system** hosted on IaaS with individual accounts and no SSO or MFA  
- **Microsoft SQL Server** used by multiple business systems  
- **HR SaaS platform** integrated with SSO and accessed by both internal staff and an external recruitment partner  

Each system presents unique risks and challenges, requiring a tailored review approach. We’ll also explore how to manage the end-to-end review process, and how to report findings in a way that drives accountability and remediation.
